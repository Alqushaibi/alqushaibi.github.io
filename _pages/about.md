I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ucas.ac.cn/), under the supervision of Associate Prof. [Yong Liu](https://iie-liuyong.github.io/) and Prof. [ Weiping Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dAJ23QEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). <br>
I received my Bachelor's degree in [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in Shenyang, China, where I am a member of 2011 International class (English) in Software College.

# Research
My research interests mainly lie in large scale machine learning with theoretical guarantees and efficient algorithms, but also kernel selection and graph-based semi-supervised learning. <br>
In facts, my works focus on generalization analysis of those areas and building effective and scalable algorithmic tools for them, to channel theory and algorithms into applications.
