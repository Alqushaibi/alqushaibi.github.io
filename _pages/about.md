I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science](https://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/) at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of professor [Bin Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~binli/). I received my Bachelor's degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/) in 2019.

# Research

My research interests mainly lie in **Artificial Intelligence Generated Content** and **AI Security**. My works focus on GANs, Diffusion, and backdoor learning of neural networks.
