* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Institute of Information Engineering](https://iie.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://ucas.ac.cn/), working with [Dr. Yong Liu](https://iie-liuyong.github.io) who is my research tutor. And My doctoral advisor is [Prof. Weiping Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dAJ23QEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
* I received my Bachelor's Degree in [Northeastern University](http://english.neu.edu.cn/) in Shenyang, China, where I am a member of 2011 International class (English) in Software College.
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in large-scale machine learning, kernel selection, and graph-based semi-supervised learning. In facts, my works focus on generalization analysis of those areas and building effective and scalable algorithmic tools for them, to channel theory and algorithms into applications.
